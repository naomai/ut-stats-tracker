# UTTracker Servers BlackList rev22
#   Last update: '15-05-06
#
# The following servers are sending fake information
# in response to \players\ query.
# Those servers were added to list for:
#   showing more players in browser than in actual game,
#   having idle players all the time, or
#   adding UT bots to the players' list.
#
# !! The servers will still be present on the tracker, however, their RF Score will be lowered by 35% 
#    Also, the player ranks won't be shown.
#
# all the ports are: GAMEPORT+1, even for other games that use different query ports
#
# useful tool: http://tracker.ut99.tk/nightly/fakeplayers.php
